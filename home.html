        During my highschool year I have always wanted to learn how to code.
        Unfortunetly they never gave me a chance to learn. So I have decided to
        learn by myself at least the basics such as html & css. Now that I have
        a chance to join the bootcamp I will try to use all their recourses to
        learn how to code profecioally, while managing a restaurant.
