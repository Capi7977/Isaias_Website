      <h2>Play Soccer</h2>
      <p>
        When I disconnect myself from the internet and have time what I love to
        do is play soccer. My dream has always been to become a professional
        soccer player and make both my parents proud. I'm 20 years old so I will
        always tell myself that that there is still hope to make it to the big
        leagues. But when the weather is bad then I would no go outside and play
        soccer, instead, I just go to the gym and work out making sure that I am
        still in good condition to keep playing soccer. The reason why I keep
        myself physically in good condition and keep pushing myself to get
        better is that I had surgery on my left knee, so a lot of people
        believed that I was going to stop playing soccer forever but in reality,
        I just want to prove all of them wrong I will always come back stronger
        and better than before. Soccer is and will always be my dream.

      <h2>Restaurant</h2>
      <p>
        Also as I am studying for my career I am working at a restaurant. The
        restaurant is owned by my father and I am very thankful my father
        decided to open a business and teach me how to drive money carefully. We
        have two restaurants, one is at Brush, Co. and we have another one at
        Pagosa Springs and I'll always be thankful to god both locations are
        being successful. Working at the restaurant helped me learn many things
        that I never thought that I would encounter this in life and with the
        help of many of my coworkers that has experience managing or being in
        big businesses I managed to understand and learn more. Although both
        restaurants were successful my father made my uncle be in charge of the
        restaurant at Pagosa Springs, which was a bigger area, but not
        everything was going to be easy he managed to control everything in the
        back but needed help managing the front. So that's when I came in and
        decided to help out my uncle, and now I am the Front Manager of the
        restaurant at Pagosa Springs. It is very stressful I'm not going to lie,
        but with the help and support from my uncle, father, and my employees I
        manage to adapt and learn new skills.

      <h2>Spend Time with Family</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever I have time, I love to just spend time with my family. I do not
        make any promises to anyone whenever I have the time to spend time with
        my family. I barely have time to spend time with my family, and time is
        gold most people do not understand. Other than that, I am very thankful
        that my mom has educated me to be the man I am right now, and I am also
        thankful for my father for teaching me how to be a man and never look
        for trouble. All I want is to make both of them very proud and for them
        to retire knowing that they will not suffer financially and have a
        successful son.
